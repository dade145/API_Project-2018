# Non-deterministic Turing machine simulator
This project has been developed as part of the "Algoritmi e Principi dell'Informatica" course at Politecnico di Milano.

## Aim
The aim of the project was to develop a simulator of non-deterministic Turing machines in the single tape variant. 

Given as input the transition function of the machine to be simulated, a string to be recognized and a _max_ number, the simulator must return '1' if the string is accepted, '0' if rejected or 'U' if it is not recognized within _max_ moves.

Only standard C libraries are allowed in the project.
